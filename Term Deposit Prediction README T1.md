**Term Deposit Prediction (Bank Marketing)**

Overview:
This project predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit using the Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI). It applies classification models and LIME for explainable AI.

Steps:

Data Exploration – checked missing values & imbalance.

Preprocessing – encoded categorical features, scaled numeric features.

Models Used – Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

Evaluation – Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, ROC Curve.

Explainability – LIME used to explain predictions.

Results:
Logistic Regression: ~85% accuracy, ROC AUC ~0.91
Random Forest: ~91% accuracy, ROC AUC ~0.93
